# Project 01 

This Homework assignment has programming parts as well as result presentation and discussion components. For the implementation you can use any programming language (e.g. Python, C++, C, Octave, ...) as long as there is a free compiler for Linux systems and it can be run without the need for additional development environments (such as Microsoft Studio, etc). Also, you can not use and libraries or functions that implement the core functionality requested in the assignment (here this means no machine learning functions or libraries are permitted). The goal here is not to provide the most efficient implementation and can use any optimization (global analytic solution or incremental gradient descent). Your submission has to include the documented code as well as instructions detailing what other libraries or components are required to run the code and how to build and run it.
