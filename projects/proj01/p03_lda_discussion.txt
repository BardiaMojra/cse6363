They both predicted correctly but LDA is a much more robust solution because
it transforms the data set to a feature space where boundaries are calculated
so that distance to class means are maximized as it reduces dimensions of the
original dataset. In this case, both perform similarly. Overall LDA is a more
robust tool for supervised training.
