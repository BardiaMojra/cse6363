Q1
OR is trainable to 100 percent accuracy because its feature are linearly
separable. On the other hand, XOR is not trainble because its features are not
linearly separable. The perceptron tries to learn then comes the "edge case"
datum and creates a large error. The XOR accuracy oscillates about a value which
depends on the number of input features.
